       Welcome to the webpage for the Cell and Developmental Biology subgroup of the <a href="https://www.smb.org/">Society for Mathematical Biology (SMB)</a>. 
More information about SMB subgroups is available <a href="https://www.smb.org/subgroups/">here</a>. This subgroup aims to bring together researchers interested in the areas of stem cell and developmental biology, modeling and analysis of developmental processes, including biochemical signalling and biomechanics, and their interplay. 
We organize activities such as minisymposia and networking events at the <a href="https://www.smb.org/past-annual-meetings/">SMB Annual Meetings</a>.      </div>
