title: Cell and Developmental Biology Subgroup

The **Subgroup on Cell and Developmental Biology** brings together researchers
who are interested in understanding cell and developmental biology
phenomena using quantitative approaches. Cell and developmental biology has
long proven a fertile ground for mathematical modeling and, with recent advances
in microscopy, image analysis, and fluorescent reporter methods, it is becoming
an increasingly quantitative discipline. We are now able to constrain
mathematical models of developmental processes, for example through
parameter estimation, increasing the potential of such models to be used in a
predictive way. The objective of this Subgroup is to accelerate these efforts, by
supporting and advancing the use of mathematical modeling as part of the
‘toolkit’ of cell and developmental biology.
