Welcome to the webpage for the Cell and Developmental Biology subgroup of the [Society for Mathematical Biology (SMB)](https://www.smb.org/). 
More information about SMB subgroups is available [here](https://www.smb.org/subgroups/). This subgroup aims to bring together researchers interested in the areas of stem cell and developmental biology, modeling and analysis of developmental processes, including biochemical signalling and biomechanics, and their interplay. 
We organize activities such as minisymposia and networking events at the [SMB Annual Meetings](https://www.smb.org/past-annual-meetings/).

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
