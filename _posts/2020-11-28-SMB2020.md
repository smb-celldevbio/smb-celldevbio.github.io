In our first SMB Cell and Developmental Biology blog post, we feature illustrations by [Maria Abou Chakra](http://individual.utoronto.ca/abouchakra/), a research associate in [Gary Bader's Lab](http://baderlab.org/Home) at the University of Toronto. Maria has summarized all the SMB 2020 CDEV talks that she attended in the following drawings, which she creates on an iPad using Autodesk Sketchbook Pro.
