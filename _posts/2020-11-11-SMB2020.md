In our first SMB Cell and Developmental Biology blog post, we feature illustrations by [Maria Abou Chakra](http://individual.utoronto.ca/abouchakra/), a research associate in [Gary Bader's Lab](http://baderlab.org/Home) at the University of Toronto. Maria has summarized all the SMB 2020 CDEV talks that she attended in the following drawings, which she creates on an iPad using Autodesk Sketchbook Pro. You can follow her on Twitter [@PatternsNGames](https://twitter.com/PatternsNGames).
