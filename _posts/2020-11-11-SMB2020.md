In our first SMB Cell and Developmental Biology blog post, we feature illustrations by [Maria Abou Chakra](http://individual.utoronto.ca/abouchakra/), a research associate in [Gary Bader's Lab](http://baderlab.org/Home) at the University of Toronto. Maria has summarized all the SMB 2020 CDEV talks that she attended in the following drawings, which she creates on an iPad using Autodesk Sketchbook Pro. You can follow her on Twitter [@PatternsNGames](https://twitter.com/PatternsNGames).




This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.
