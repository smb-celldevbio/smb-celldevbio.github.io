In this blog post, we share our slides from the CDEV Subgroup meeting, and overview some information about CDEV and some ideas that we discussed in Columbus. See full details in our slides.

During the [2023 SMB Annual Meeting](https://2023.smb.org) in Columbus, Ohio, the CDEV Subgroup held a business meeting to share our activities and get feedback from the CDEV community on what activities our subgroup should focus on in the coming year. Thank you to all who attended this meeting and shared their ideas, as well as to the presenters, minisymposium organizers, and volunteers who judged CDEV posters at the SMB Annual Meeting!

**CDEV Ideas and Future Directions**

During the CDEV subgroup meeting at the SMB Annual Meeting, we discussed and requested subgroup feedback on the possibility of moving or extending our social-media presence (i.e., to LinkedIn, Mastodon, or Instagram), chatted about the possibility of organizing CDEV tutorials or an online mini-workshop, discussed subgroup priorities on how to spend our funding (the consensus was to use funding for prizes, childcare support, and travel support), and discussed ways to support early-career researchers (i.e., through organizing mock interviews to prepare for Zoom academic interviews). Stay tuned, and please reach out to us if you have any questions or suggestions!
