The Cell and Developmental Biology Subgroup is highlighting the poster prize winners of the 2022 European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology in a series of blog posts. There were three recipients of poster prizes: [Jelle van der Voort](https://smb-celldevbio.github.io/2022-12-19-vanderVoort/), Svetlana Petrenko (this post), and Yiteng Dang. We hear from Svetlana Petrenko in this post.

**Svetlana Petrenko, Research Fellow at University College London, United Kingdom**

**Prize poster: Influence of the free energy form on modelling of biosilica patterns formation in diatoms**

From Svetlana:

*I am a Research Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at UCL. I completed my PhD in 2021 at Ecole Polytechnique in France. My dissertation work was on chemo-mechanical couplings in inelastic solids. In February 2022 I joined UCL where my research work focus on mathematical modelling of diatom frustule morphogenesis and evolution of shape. My research interest fields include: Solid mechanics, Mathematical biology, Material homogenization, Multiphysics coupling, Continuum mechanics, Thermodynamics.*
