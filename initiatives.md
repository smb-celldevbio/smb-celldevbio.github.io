## Virtual Flash Talks Session

Think three pages for a research statement is short? What about distilling your work into just three minutes with the help of a <em>single slide</em>? In Spring 2026, we invite researchers at all career stages to take on this CHALLENGE and join other members of the SMB CDEV community for a virtual gathering aimed at offering researchers a platform to share their scientific interests and vision in a friendly and informal setting. **Presentations should be accessible to a non-specialist audience and highlight the broader significance of your work.**

To sign up, please fill out the form [here](https://forms.gle/FugESCrwYcocPazR7).

Here are [some examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1xo6qWTmoc) for inspiration from the 2025 Oxford Mathematics 3-minute thesis challenge (featuring 2 fantastic math bio entries!).

## Discussion Group: Modeling Cell Development and Regeneration

Dr. Maria Abou Chakra has been running a discussion group on "Modeling Cell
development and Regeneration". The goal of this group is to explore current
models in cell development and regeneration, and discuss challenges, emerging
questions and solutions relating to this topic. It also aims to build a community of
researchers with shared interests. We warmly recommend this group; you can sign up [here](https://join.slack.com/t/modeling-cell-dev/shared_invite/zt-oguwfa02-KWUWhGPw6u7HAgy1tp8QRw).

# Past Activities
## Mooc Academic Interviews

We are excited to offer a two-part job preparation series for job applicants seeking academic and industry jobs. To help candidates with this process, we will be hosting an Interviewing 101 webinar, as well as a practice opportunity through mock interviews. Whether you are applying for postdoctoral positions, tenure-track positions, or jobs in industry, we hope to prepare you for what the interviewing process is like.

## Virtual Cell and Development Festival Week

The Cell and Developmental Biology Subgroup hosted its first virtual mini-conference (a week of virtual mini-symposia highlighting research in our community, plenary talks, and professional-development resources) in March 2024.
