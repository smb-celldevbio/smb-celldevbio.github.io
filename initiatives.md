The Cell and Developmental Biology Subgroup is planning to host a week of virtual minisymposia highlighting research in our community and professional development resources in March 2024. For more information, see the website [here](https://smb-celldevbio.github.io/cdevfestival/).


## Discussion Group: Modeling Cell Development and Regeneration 

Dr. Maria Abou Chakra has been running a discussion group on "Modeling Cell
development and Regeneration". The goal of this group is to explore current
models in cell development and regeneration, and discuss challenges, emerging
questions and solutions relating to this topic. It also aims to build a community of
researchers with shared interests. We warmly recommend this group; you can sign up [here](https://join.slack.com/t/modeling-cell-dev/shared_invite/zt-oguwfa02-KWUWhGPw6u7HAgy1tp8QRw).
