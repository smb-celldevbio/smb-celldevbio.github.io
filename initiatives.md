## Virtual Cell and Development Festival Week

The Cell and Developmental Biology Subgroup hosted its first virtual mini-conference (a week of virtual mini-symposia highlighting research in our community, plenary talks, and professional-development resources) in March 2024. For more information, see the website [here](https://smb-celldevbio.github.io/cdevfestival/).


## Discussion Group: Modeling Cell Development and Regeneration 

Dr. Maria Abou Chakra has been running a discussion group on "Modeling Cell
development and Regeneration". The goal of this group is to explore current
models in cell development and regeneration, and discuss challenges, emerging
questions and solutions relating to this topic. It also aims to build a community of
researchers with shared interests. We warmly recommend this group; you can sign up [here](https://join.slack.com/t/modeling-cell-dev/shared_invite/zt-oguwfa02-KWUWhGPw6u7HAgy1tp8QRw).
